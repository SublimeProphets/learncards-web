## learncards-web 

In time, the name learncards-web gets deprecated. This project was used in my education-time as developer for my own, and i used it like a framework for diffrent projects in scool.
One example which will not be updated is <a href="https://github.com/skamster/death-guestbook">death-guestbook</a>, which is written in one day and is fully working with users and roles.

### Setup
https://github.com/skamster/Peta/wiki/Installation
### Status
Basic plugin-loads are working, no role-stuff yet.. unstable so far!
<del>There are many improvements needed since i was in a restructering with a friend (see fullUser in <a href="https://github.com/skamster/death-guestbook">dg</a>). </del>
