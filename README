******Livedemo***********
A Livedemo could be found here.. actually, there are some debug-messages, but it should work.

Access works just over ssl. You should install the cacert-certificate (http://cacert.org) then it's a trusted source :)
Remember: You are admin, if you're registered. Please respect other users. Thanks! (it will be changed for productive systems, of course!)
*************************

If you want to use this project from source, you have to do some little work.
1. Create 2 directorys in the folder; templates_c and admin/templates_c . These must be writeable!
2. Execute the SQL/testing_mysql.sql into your database. It should work on mysql, others aren't tested (may they work?)
3. Configure the config.php-file. Not every option is used now, but the databasesettings are!
4. There are securityleaks and there could also be changes in the structure which make old datas unusable - be shure about that and do NOT USE IT for productive systems (as example: every new user is a admin - i use that if my other users got some problems..)
5. Test and enjoy :)
